The following is a list of changes from the old 2014 "English V2" translation project.

The patch is now based on Extra Edition ROM (ULJM05957 v1.00).
The old "V2" patch was based on "non-E2 patched to E2" ROM (ULJM05781 v1.01).

Script retranslation/editing - in short, a complete redo:
* Main story
* Fragments
* E2 on-disk DLC
* Battle event texts
* Encyclopedia (previously untranslated)
* Newspapers (previously untranslated)
* Dossier files
* Non-E2 off-disk DLC (previously untranslated)

UI:
* Fixed various errors (think infamous Fr/Rr Def, out of bounds items and such)
* Improved various game terminology across all UIs and menus
* Improved Seal descriptions' style and consistency
* Updated some accessory names
* Added untranslated weapons (both on-disk and DLC)
* Added untranslated map objects (gates, containers)
* Added Blueprints (weapon plans in VC2) in BP-... format
* Fixed Carisa's shop name weirdness, bottom line sub-texts and out of bounds cases
* Changed various menus/settings/misc wording

Missions:
* Mission and event names on march maps (chapters, fragments etc)
* Added Mission Details screen texts for E2 on-disk DLCs, Fragments, Post-Game missions
* Some mission objectives reworded
* Various mission descriptions rewritten
* Control the Port - fixed the missing Ace bug. For this, all Aces had to be retranslated with vanilla Japanese file as a base and will not match "V2" translation and/or fandom wiki. Refer to provided spreadsheet of Ace locations if needed.

Mission UI clarity edits that are not strictly translation:
* Multiple [Victory]/[Limit] conditions on March Map UI are listed separately.
* Decoy Supplies (Carisa's Maxim Fragment mission) now lists missing from original game Margit Detachment only restriction.
* Evaluation Exercise 2 (postgame shop mission) now lists missing from original game No Tank restriction.
* [Strategic Effect] conditions now point to respective related mission by name instead of generic wording.

Tutorials:
* Fixed out of bounds issues
* Many tutorials rewritten for improved terminology consistency
* Colored text is now used instead of most "quoted" terms
* Usage of x-o buttons in tutorial text conforms to what you would see on western psp/emulator.

Orders:
* Descriptions cleaned up (no more full-width japanese C P and such, descriptions match different UIs)
* Sneak Attack renamed to traditional Attack Weak Spot
* Added untranslated Lydia's/Gusurg's orders
* Changed Dahau's Recall to Reinforcement

Potentials:
* Description proofreading
* Some names retranslated/fixed
* Description wording for Battle Potentials now matches between Unit Details and Master Table
* Margit's Lost potential will correctly list actual in-game effect of Accuracy/vsPersonnel Down rather than Accuracy/Evasion Down (original JP description is incorrect).

New textures
* Map of Gallia - added Story/Fragment/DLC, removed kanji for Chapter and Fragment on the hover name row
* Opening scene for main chapters and fragments - English sub-titles match chapter titles, replaced japanese for "Fragment"
* Base Camp -> Bulletin Board - replaced japanese in BB page titles
* Deployment UI - replaced japanese for Area Effect
* Combat - readability improvements for Command and Action mode, such as Kill/Shots/Aim, Ally/Enemy/Camp/Reserve, AreaMax texts
* Boss intro cutscenes' nameplates are now in English


Textures that were NOT translated or edited:
* onomaetopia textures, such as all gun sounds (boom/bang/whoosh etc) are in japanese
* tutorial images are in japanese
* world map, march maps etc have not been corrected (e.g. Tilka -> Tiluca and such)
